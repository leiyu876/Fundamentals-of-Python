Here are 10 different variants for Python code that read a file:

**Variant 1: Simple Read**
```
with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
    contents = file.read()
    print(contents)
```

**Variant 2: Read Line by Line**
```
with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line.strip())
```

**Variant 3: Read into a List**
```
with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
    print(lines)
```

**Variant 4: Read with Encoding**
```
with open('file.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    contents = file.read()
    print(contents)
```

**Variant 5: Read Binary File**
```
with open('file.bin', 'rb') as file:
    contents = file.read()
    print(contents)
```

**Variant 6: Read with Buffer Size**
```
with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
    buffer_size = 1024
    while True:
        chunk = file.read(buffer_size)
        if not chunk:
            break
        print(chunk)
```

**Variant 7: Read with Error Handling**
```
try:
    with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
        contents = file.read()
        print(contents)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

**Variant 8: Read using `pathlib`**
```
import pathlib

file_path = pathlib.Path('file.txt')
contents = file_path.read_text()
print(contents)
```

**Variant 9: Read using `numpy`**
```
import numpy as np

data = np.loadtxt('file.txt')
print(data)
```

**Variant 10: Read using `pandas`**
```
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('file.txt')
print(df)
```

Note that each variant has its own use case and may not be suitable for all types of files or scenarios.
