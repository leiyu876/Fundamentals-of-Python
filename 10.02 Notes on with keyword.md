Here are 10 different variants of Python code that demonstrate the use of the `with` keyword:

1. Basic `with` statement:
```
with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:
    print(f.read())
```
This code opens a file in read mode and assigns it to the variable `f`. The file is automatically closed when the block of code indented under the `with` statement is exited.      

2. `with` statement with multiple resources:
```
with open('file1.txt', 'r') as f1, open('file2.txt', 'r') as f2:
    print(f1.read())
    print(f2.read())
```
This code opens two files in read mode and assigns them to the variables `f1` and `f2`. Both files are automatically closed when the block of code indented under the `with` statement is exited.

3. `with` statement with a lock:
```
import threading
lock = threading.Lock()
with lock:
    # critical section of code
    print("Lock acquired")
```
This code acquires a lock using the `with` statement, which ensures that the critical section of code is executed only when the lock is acquired.

4. `with` statement with a context manager:
```
class MyContextManager:
    def __enter__(self):
        print("Entering context")
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        print("Exiting context")

with MyContextManager() as cm:
    print("Inside context")
```
This code defines a custom context manager class `MyContextManager` that prints messages when entering and exiting the context. The `with` statement is used to create an instance of the context manager and execute a block of code within the context.

5. `with` statement with a generator:
```
def my_generator():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3

with my_generator() as gen:
    print(next(gen))
    print(next(gen))
    print(next(gen))
```
This code defines a generator function `my_generator` that yields three values. The `with` statement is used to create a generator object and iterate over its values.

6. `with` statement with a file-like object:
```
import io
with io.StringIO('hello world') as f:
    print(f.read())
```
This code creates a file-like object using the `io.StringIO` class and assigns it to the variable `f`. The file-like object is automatically closed when the block of code indented under the `with` statement is exited.

7. `with` statement with a temporary directory:
```
import tempfile
with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmpdir:
    print(tmpdir)
    # use the temporary directory
```
This code creates a temporary directory using the `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory` class and assigns it to the variable `tmpdir`. The temporary directory is automatically deleted when the block of code indented under the `with` statement is exited.

8. `with` statement with a connection:
```
import sqlite3
with sqlite3.connect('example.db') as conn:
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM table')
    print(cursor.fetchall())
```
This code connects to a SQLite database using the `sqlite3.connect` function and assigns the connection object to the variable `conn`. The connection is automatically closed when the block of code indented under the `with` statement is exited.

9. `with` statement with a socket:
```
import socket
with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
    s.connect(('www.example.com', 80))
    s.sendall(b'GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: www.example.com\r\n\r\n')
    print(s.recv(1024))
```
This code creates a socket using the `socket.socket` function and assigns it to the variable `s`. The socket is automatically closed when the block of code indented under the `with` statement is exited.

10. `with` statement with a contextlib.contextmanager:
```
import contextlib
@contextlib.contextmanager
def my_context_manager():
    print("Entering context")
    try:
        yield
    finally:
        print("Exiting context")

with my_context_manager():
    print("Inside context")
```
This code defines a context manager using the `@contextlib.contextmanager` decorator and prints messages when entering and exiting the context. The `with` statement is used to create an instance of the context manager and execute a block of code within the context.

These examples demonstrate the versatility of the `with` statement in Python and how it can be used to manage resources, locks, and contexts in a clean and efficient way.
