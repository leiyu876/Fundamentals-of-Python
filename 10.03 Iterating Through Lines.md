Here are 10 different variants of Python code for iterating through lines:

1. Using a for loop:
```
with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line.strip())
```
2. Using a while loop:
```
with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:
    while True:
        line = f.readline()
        if not line:
            break
        print(line.strip())
```
3. Using the `readlines()` method:
```
with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:
    lines = f.readlines()
    for line in lines:
        print(line.strip())
```
4. Using a list comprehension:
```
with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:
    lines = [line.strip() for line in f]
    for line in lines:
        print(line)
```
5. Using the `enumerate()` function:
```
with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:
    for i, line in enumerate(f):
        print(f"Line {i+1}: {line.strip()}")
```
6. Using a generator expression:
```
with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:
    for line in (line.strip() for line in f):
        print(line)
```
7. Using the `map()` function:
```
with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:
    for line in map(str.strip, f):
        print(line)
```
8. Using the `filter()` function:
```
with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:
    for line in filter(None, f):
        print(line.strip())
```
9. Using a context manager with a generator:
```
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def open_file(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        yield (line.strip() for line in f)

with open_file('file.txt') as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line)
```
10. Using the `pandas` library:
```
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('file.txt', header=None)
for line in df[0]:
    print(line)
```
Note that these examples assume that the file is in the same directory as the Python script. You may need to modify the file path accordingly.
