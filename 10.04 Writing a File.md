Here are 10 different variants of Python code for writing to a file:

**Variant 1: Simple Write**
```python
with open("example.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Hello, World!")
```
**Variant 2: Write with Mode**
```python
with open("example.txt", "w+") as f:
    f.write("Hello, World!")
```
**Variant 3: Write with Encoding**
```python
with open("example.txt", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    f.write("Hello, World!")
```
**Variant 4: Write Multiple Lines**
```python
with open("example.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Line 1\n")
    f.write("Line 2\n")
    f.write("Line 3\n")
```
**Variant 5: Write with Print Statement**
```python
with open("example.txt", "w") as f:
    print("Hello, World!", file=f)
```
**Variant 6: Write with Format Strings**
```python
with open("example.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Hello, %s!" % "World")
```
**Variant 7: Write with f-Strings (Python 3.6+**
```python
with open("example.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write(f"Hello, {'World'}!")
```
**Variant 8: Write with Buffering**
```python
with open("example.txt", "w", buffering=1024) as f:
    f.write("Hello, World!")
```
**Variant 9: Write with Append Mode**
```python
with open("example.txt", "a") as f:
    f.write("Hello, World!")
```
**Variant 10: Write with Context Manager and Error Handling**
```python
try:
    with open("example.txt", "w") as f:
        f.write("Hello, World!")
except IOError as e:
    print(f"Error writing to file: {e}")
```
Note that some of these variants may have slightly different behavior or use cases, but they all demonstrate different ways to write to a file in Python.
